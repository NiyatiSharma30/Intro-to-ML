# Intro-to-ML

Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data and improve their performance without explicit programming. It uses algorithms and statistical models to identify patterns, make predictions, and automate decision-making. Some key aspects of machine learning include:

Supervised Learning: Involves training a model on labeled data, where the input-output relationships are known (e.g., classification and regression tasks like predicting house prices or classifying images).

Unsupervised Learning: The model learns from unlabeled data, identifying hidden patterns or structures (e.g., clustering, anomaly detection, dimensionality reduction).

Reinforcement Learning: A model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties (used in robotics, gaming, and self-driving cars).

Training and Testing: Machine learning models are trained on a portion of the data, and then tested on unseen data to evaluate their performance and ability to generalize.

Overfitting and Underfitting: Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise instead of general patterns, while underfitting happens when the model is too simple to capture the underlying trends.

Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming the most relevant data inputs (features) to improve model performance.

Popular Algorithms:

Linear Regression: For predicting numerical values.

Decision Trees: For making decisions based on features.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): For classification tasks.

Neural Networks: For complex tasks like image recognition or natural language processing.

Deep Learning: A subset of ML involving neural networks with many layers, which can learn from vast amounts of data and solve highly complex problems, such as voice recognition and autonomous driving.

Machine learning powers a wide range of applications, from recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon) to self-driving cars, medical diagnosis, fraud detection, and more!
